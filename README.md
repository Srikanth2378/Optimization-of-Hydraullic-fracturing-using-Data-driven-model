# Optimization-of-Hydraullic-fracturing-using-Data-driven-model
Optimization of hydraulic fracturing design is critical to achieving a successful well stimulation operation. The proppant volume, proppant size, and fracturing fluid volume are some of the challenges inhibiting successful hydraulic fracturing operations across the world i.e., to provide better estimation for post-fracture production in the Shaly sandstone formation. The hydraulic fracturing industry uses some rules of thumb in addition to trial and error in conjunction with fracture simulators to optimize hydraulic fracturing jobs using physics-based models and to estimate the post-fracture productivity. However, the optimization cannot be achieved due to complications of hydraulic fracture jobs and uncertainty in hydraulic fracturing modeling.The goal of the paper is to provide a practical way to minimize the cost of material (proppant and fluid) to get the maximum productivity from the well and investigate the effect of treating pressure, screen outs, ISIP on post-fracture production to provide a tool for future hydraulic fracture optimization to get the best treatment for shaly sandstone formation. The data used in the paper are the operational parameters for hydraulic fracture treatments from Boggess Gas wells from the Marcellus Shale Energy and Environment Laboratory (MSEEL). This data is combined with well-logging data and reservoir parameters to train the machine learning model to control the production data to get the maximum well productivity.The paper introduces a way to optimize hydraulic fracturing using machine learning models to find the best treatments to get the optimum production performance after the hydraulic fracture job.The data-driven machine learning models after several hyperparameters optimizations succeeded to optimize the hydraulic fracture treatments & provided a good tool for shale gas development optimization in similar formations.
